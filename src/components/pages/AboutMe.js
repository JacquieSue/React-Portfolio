            <p>
            I am a full stack web developer, that has experience primarily in JavaScript and MERN. Prior to Web Development, I was working in Customer Service, but have always had a strong desire to obtain new skills and grow exceptionally within a field. I was on the waitlist to begin the Radiology Program at PCC, but switched my field of study to Web Development. As a developer, there is substantial amount of knowledge to access, and with each new skill acquired, I feel my passion growing stronger. My goal is to work with senior developers to enhance my knowledge and continue to develop my skills within this job field, so I can contribute and eventually become a senior developer/engineer myself.
